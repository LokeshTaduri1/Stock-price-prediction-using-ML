# 📈 Stock Market Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict stock market prices using historical data and various machine learning models including **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **LSTM**. It demonstrates how traditional ML and deep learning can be used to forecast financial trends based on real-world data.

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**

---

## 🗃️ Dataset

- Historical stock data for **Tesla (TSLA)**.
- Sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

Dataset includes:
- Open, High, Low, Close prices
- Volume
- Date

## 📊 Results

- **Random Forest** achieved an **R² score of 0.92**, demonstrating high accuracy.
- LSTM effectively captured non-linear trends and performed well for short-term forecasting.
- Visualizations clearly showed the alignment between actual and predicted prices.

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- Created with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.
- Include line plots comparing actual vs. predicted stock prices.
